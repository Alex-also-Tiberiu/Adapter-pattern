 * Testing a HSet of MapAdapter.setKey() <br>

 * Since the class is private, a MapAdapter variable is used, which through the SetKey() method will instantiate the object to be tested with HSetâ€™s methods.<br>
 * The method that instantiates the object to be tested is setup(), which will be executed before all tests.<br>
 * In the first part the HSet methods will be tested, but in the second part the backing to MapAdapter will be verified.<br>
