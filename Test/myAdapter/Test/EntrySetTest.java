 * Testing a HSet of MapAdapter.Entry <br>
 * This class was generated to return entry objects from the map, so it implements HSet, and must respond appropriately to the HSet interface. <br>
 * Since the class is private, a MapAdapter variable is used, which through the entrySet() method will instantiate the object to be tested with HSetâ€™s methods.<br>
 * The method that instantiates the object to be tested is setup(), which will be executed before all tests.<br>
 * In the first part the HSet methods will be tested, but in the second part the backing to MapAdapter will be verified.<br>
 * Tests of this class are performed by the ESTestRunner class. <br>
