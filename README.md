## this is a software engineering exam. <br />
The homework is intended to learn:
- what is an adapter pattern
- how to test a project using Junit 4
- how to write a documentation <br />

Using the Java JDK 1.2 was implemented the [List](https://github.com/Sputnik10g/Homework1/blob/start/src/myAdapter/ListAdapter.java) using the [vector](https://github.com/Sputnik10g/Homework1/blob/start/src/myAdapter/HVector.java) 
from the library,<br />
and also it was used the [hashtable](https://github.com/Sputnik10g/Homework1/blob/start/src/myAdapter/HHashtable.java) 
from the library to implement the [map](https://github.com/Sputnik10g/Homework1/blob/start/src/myAdapter/MapAdapter.java).<br />
the folder : [src/myadapter](https://github.com/Sputnik10g/Homework1/tree/start/src/myAdapter)
contains the source code, where all the headers file are described. <br />
The functions used for the two final structures are described in the header files 
[HMap.java](https://github.com/Sputnik10g/Homework1/blob/start/src/myAdapter/HMap.java) and
[HList.java](https://github.com/Sputnik10g/Homework1/blob/start/src/myAdapter/HList.java).<br />
Finally into the folder [test/myAdapter/test](https://github.com/Sputnik10g/Homework1/tree/start/Test/myAdapter/Test)
there are all the test divided by modules and described.<br /> 
each module is a test or a testrunner object.<br />
This object it may be one of the two principle structure, or an additional object that one of the
two structure may return with a function.
